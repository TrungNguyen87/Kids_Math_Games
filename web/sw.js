/**
 * Service worker: what makes the app work with no network at all.
 *
 * This is the piece that turns a website into something a child can use on a
 * tablet in the car, at a grandparent's house with no wifi password, or in a
 * classroom whose connection has fallen over. After one visit every game is on
 * the device.
 *
 * Strategy, deliberately simple:
 *   - install: precache the whole app (it is small, and a half-cached app that
 *     works for four games and 404s on the fifth is worse than none);
 *   - fetch: cache-first for our own files, because they are versioned by
 *     BUILD_ID and therefore never stale within a version;
 *   - activate: delete every cache that is not this version, then take over.
 *
 * BUILD_ID is rewritten at deploy time by .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
 * with the commit SHA. That is what makes an update actually reach a child who
 * installed the app three weeks ago: a new SHA means a new cache name, which
 * means a full re-fetch on the next visit.
